How to run my project
Because the branching didn't work the way I wanted it to on my computer, I ended up going with seperate files for each problem (I combined a couple that were similure). I got the makefile to work with simplechain.c. I can see why it is very useful. However, with each problem seperate,it was easy just to compile and run the project file individually.
