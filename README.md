# OS-Project-1
Project 1 operating systems
Setting up took some work. I needed to figure out vim, how to get into hoare, makefiles, navigation etc. 
I had to reteach myself about makefiles. (Had a certain teacher for the pre-req class). The handout didn't help me to understand how it works, but I found a video that helped a lot called Using make and writing Makefile (in C++ or C). I got it to fulfill the requirements but curious why it is so different from the handout. I need to look into makefiles further.

I had used Github before for previous classes. The handout confused me but I found a better resource online for using git on the server. I think because I need to see it from a big picture perspective and I am very visual. The instructions seems to be missing some steps and explanations.  I had some trouble because my computer wouldn't let me add branches due to some memory error I need to look into. I wanted to use branches originally. The server had some issues as well. Sometimes it crashes randomly. While I had a basic understanding of git, I did need to learn how to use it with my local computer and the server.  

The questions themselves were not that difficult to figure out I don't think. (Unless I actually got them wrong).  My problem was getting the project to run the way I expected it to. 

How to run my project
Because the branching didn't work the way I wanted it to on my computer, I ended up going with seperate files for each problem (I combined a couple that were similure). I got the makefile to work with simplechain.c. I can see why it is very useful. However, with each problem seperate,it was easy just to compile and run the project file individually.
